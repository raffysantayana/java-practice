# java-practice

## About
This repository is where I will practice the following in Java, since I've primarily used Python for most of my work. To practice, my goal will be to recreate my [all_connects repository](https://github.com/raffysantayana/all_connects).

## Skills to Practice:
- Java programming style guide
- Defining classes
- Understanding dtype parallels to Python (e.g. hashmap <-> dictionary?)
- Familiarize with keywords (super, final, etc.)
- Play with string and stringbuffer
- class vs interface
- much, much more
